                        <p id="about-me-info"> Hi, my name is Goutham Swaminathan but most of my friends call me "Gooth". I am currently a junior studying in the AEDT academy at the <a href="https://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/bca-home" id="bca">Bergen County Academies</a>, a magnet high-school located in Hackensack, New Jersey that was recognized as the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/high-schools/americas-top-high-schools-2015">#5 School in the Nation by Newsweek in 2015</a>. I am involved in various clubs and organizations at BCA (Bergen County Academies) such as National Spanish Honor Society, hackBCA Organizing Team (Art sector), SPARK, and Diversity Alliance. In addition, I am also the co-president of the South Asian Club at my school, which hosts various events to spread South Asian culture while raising money to donate to India-based charities like <a href="http://www.sahaita.org/">Sahaita</a>. As co-president, I am in charge of coordinating with our faculty advisor to organize events, introduce new members, and handle financials. I am also a senior counselor at E-Camp, a student-run engineering camp held for incoming freshmen in order to introduce them to basic engineering skills as well as help them have an enjoyable time. As a counselor, I, along with others, am in charge of organizing the camp, planning events, and creating projects for the students. Outside of school, I am a volunteer at <a href="refreshbolivia.com">Refresh Bolivia</a>, currently acting as the cinematographer and am in the process of producing an RB-affiliated documentary about the system of public health in Bolivia. In addition, I also play an important role in maintaining the social media accounts of Refresh Bolivia and helping produce videos about Refresh Bolivia that are submitted to grant-based competitions. In my spare time, I maintain a small YouTube channel named "<a href="https://youtube.com/gooth">Gooth</a>", which has garnered  250 subscribers and over 50,000 views. Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy it!</p>

                            <p>This was the date when I uploaded my first video on YouTube. I had a snow day from school and I decided, on a whim, to post a tutorial for a card flourish that I barely knew how to do. It was a relatively mediocre video and it was not a very good tutorial either. But I was proud of it because it was my first attempt at creating cinematic content. Even since that day, "Gooth" has been a journal of sorts; a way for me to document my journey through filmmaking. Below are some of my best videos. There is certainly much room for improvement but these are the works I am most proud of.</p>

                            <p align="center">January 1st, 2018</p>
                                <p>A few months ago, I was searching through my house for a tripod when I came across a 35mm film camera. It was a Pentax Zoom 60x.</p>
                                <img src="assets/img/pentax.jpg"/>
                                <p><br>I was intrigued by this camera because it had been a very long time since I had seen one. The next time I visited my grandparents, I asked them if they had any other film cameras. After a few minutes of searching, my grandfather pulled out two more film cameras. One of them was a Canon EOS Rebel II.</p>
                                <img src="assets/img/rebel.jpg"/>
                                <p><br>I looked up the name and found out that it was a semi-automatic SLR made in the 90s that could produce very nice images. The second camera was a Canonet QL17.</p>
                                <img src="assets/img/canonet.jpg"/>
                                <p><br>This camera was a pure vintage; it was a fully manual camera produced in the 1960s and was considered an almost-professional grade camera. It occurred to me then that in a digital world, these cameras had begun to lose their places as means of taking pictures. All the memories that my parents and grandparents had made with these cameras could not be replicated in a digital manner. As a result, I embarked on a journey to make the same memories by capturing primarily analog photos. This experiment has taught me much not only about the different aspects to photography that are made easy with digital cameras like proper exposure, shutter speed, and aperture but also about how wholesome shooting film can be. The mechanical process of taking the photos, sending them to be developed, receiving the negatives, and scanning them all for a set of 24 photos may seem like a waste of time but the satisfaction of finally being able to look at the fruits of one's labor makes it all worth it.</p> 
                                    <p>The following are the photos I took during the experiment. Although many of them are underexposed, overexposed, and out of focus, they still belong here. Everything's an aesthetic.</p>
