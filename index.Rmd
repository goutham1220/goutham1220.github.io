Hi, my name is Goutham Swaminathan and I am currently a rising sophomore studying Data Science and Epidemiology at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) in Rochester, NY.  You can follow the projects I am working on through my [GitHub page](https://github.com/goutham1220). In my spare time, I maintain a small YouTube channel named ["Gooth"](https://www.youtube.com/gooth), which has garnered over 500 subscribers and over 100,000 views. Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy it!
